# new-customer-churn-predict
prediction of the probability of a customer being churn by machine learning algorithms
this file contains a jupyter notebook file. 
in a data set obtained via kaggle, the probability of whether a customer will churn depending on certain parameters was observed. With the heat map, the variables that the customer's churn depends on the most were determined.
